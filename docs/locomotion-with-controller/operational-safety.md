title: Operational Safety

???+ abstract "Objective"
    Prepare a safe environment in which Spot will be operated.

Before operating Spot, make sure that your surroundings are safe and clear! If an environment or robot behavior seems unsafe, stop immediately.

Review the [Spot Instructions for Use](https://d3cjkvgbik1jtv.cloudfront.net/Spot+IFU/Spot+IFU+v2.0.pdf) for a complete list of safety instructions.

???+ warning
    Do not touch or operate Spot if any damage is noticed and wet parts of the body are exposed to contact.

    Contact Boston Dynamics Support in case of apparent damage of parts.

???+ danger
    Exposure to severe electrical and electromagnetic environments may determine non-apparent damages or latent failures of Spot. 

    Using Spot after exposure to high voltage or indirect contact may result in unexpected failure of the electrical system.

???+ warning
    Spot may collide with people or objects, even with its obstacle detection system enabled. 

    Operators and bystanders should assume that Spot may move unexpectedly at any time.

???+ tip
    The Emergency Stop function must be used only when you have full visibility of Spot and its surroundings. 

    A manually activated Emergency Stop will override any active control, and therefore could determine additional hazards if it causes a forced loss of stability
