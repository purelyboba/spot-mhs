title: Coding Spot
---

???+ abstract "Objective"
    Learn how to control Spot using code, including AprilTag detection and arm manipulation.

???+ prequisites
    Have completed the basics of controlling Spot with a controller. Have a computer to program on, preferably a UNIX computer (Mac OS/Linux).

## Introduction

Now that you have learned how to control Spot using a controller, we will move on to more complex tasks by coding Spot using the Python programming language. First, we will get our computers set up with the Spot SDK, and then we will move into basic movement. From there, we will go into more complicated topics, such as fiducial (AprilTag) detection and arm manipulation.
