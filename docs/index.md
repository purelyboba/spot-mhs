# **Welcome!**

Between the 2022-23 and 2023-24 school years, students at Millburn High School were given the opportunity to work hands on with the Spot robot dog, courtesy of Boston Dynamics. This website serves as a documentation of our journey with Spot, and what we were able to do with this incredible robot. 

Included in this documentation is our OpenPayload project, which offers an open source modular payload system to expand the functionality of the Spot robot. We include all the CAD files for this project, as well as an example use case. 

Also included within this documentation is an effort to make the Spot SDK easier to understand and use. We do this in the form of an educational curriculum, which teaches readers how to program and manipulate Spot.
