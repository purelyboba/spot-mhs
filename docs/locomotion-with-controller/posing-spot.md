## Practice posing Spot

- From the sit position, stand Spot by pressing and holding Stand on the controller or just press the B button
- From the standing position, pose the robot by manipulating the joystick controls
- Adjust the height of the robot using the slider on the tablet screen. Note that the posing functionality is maintained regardless of the robot height. Medium height is the most stable for posing
