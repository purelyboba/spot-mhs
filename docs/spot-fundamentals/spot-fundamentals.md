# Spot Fundamentals

## Objective

Effectively and safely utilize Spot by gaining a comprehensive understanding of its parts, features, power management, startup procedures, and storage, while also recognizing its basic operation philosophy and limitations. Prioritize safety and security in all aspects of Spot's usage.

## Prerequisites

Possession of a fully functional Spot, complete with its compatible batteries, charger, and the optional Payload Arm.

## Introduction

Imagine your classroom as a company's warehouse, brimming with goods that require safety checks every evening. Instead of manual inspections, you've brought in Spot, a cutting-edge robot designed to streamline and improve these safety reviews.

To effectively utilize Spot, a foundational understanding is essential. In "Spot Fundamentals", we dive into the basics: its structure, the movement of its joints, and its energy source. Beyond just mechanics, this section provides a holistic view of Spot, setting the groundwork for its full range of capabilities.

Even as an autonomous robot, Spot benefits from human oversight. Properly managing its startup and shutdown processes is crucial for its optimal performance and durability. Safety is paramount, both for Spot and those around it. Additionally, for those keen on exploring further, we touch upon the advanced features, like the Spot Arm payload.

Progressing through this curriculum, each segment moves us closer to our main objective: preparing Spot for its nightly safety missions in your classroom's simulated 'warehouse'. By the end, Spot wonâ€™t just be hardware; it will represent the intersection of education, technology, and practical application.
