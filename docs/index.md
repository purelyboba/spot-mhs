# **Welcome!**

Between the 2022-23 and 2023-24 school years, students at Millburn High School were given the opportunity to work hands on with the Spot robot dog, courtesy of Boston Dynamics. This website serves as a documentation of our journey with Spot, and what we were able to do with this incredible robot. 

Included within this documentation is an **educational curriculum** to simplify the process of setting up and using Spot. We have modified the Spot SDK documentation and Spot support pages with our own comments and additions, in an effort to make Spot as easy to use as possible. We aim for this documentation to be the only reference you need to get started with Spot.

Also included in this documentation is our **OpenPayload** project, which offers an open source modular payload system to expand the functionality of the Spot robot. We include all the CAD files for this project, as well as an example use case of the system.
